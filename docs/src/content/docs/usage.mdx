On this page, you can find information on how you can import and use the library in your project.

## Accessing types
### Import from&nbsp;`obsidian`

If you want to access types from the `obsidian` module, the import syntax is unchanged:

```ts
import { App } from 'obsidian';

function printInternalPlugins(app: App): void {
  console.log(app.internalPlugins);
}
```

### Import from&nbsp;`obsidian-typings`

Additional interfaces added by this package (which are not documented anywhere in the official API) can be imported using:

```ts
import { InternalPlugins } from 'obsidian-typings';

const internalPlugins: InternalPlugins = this.app.internalPlugins;
```

### Extend with your own typings

If you need to extend the typings provided by this package with your own types,
add the following to any `.d.ts` file in your project:

```ts {4}
// This is a very essential line.
// If you don't have any other top-level `import/export` statements,
//      the typings listed below will work not as expected.
export {};
declare module 'obsidian-typings' {
  interface PluginsPluginsRecord {
    myPlugin: MyPlugin;
  }
}
```

## Using implementations
### Via&nbsp;`obsidian-typings/implementations`

Additional helper functions/types/... added by this package, can be added by importing from `obsidian-typings/implementations`:

```ts
import { InternalPluginName } from 'obsidian-typings/implementations';

this.app.internalPlugins.getEnabledPluginById(InternalPluginName.FileExplorer);
```

(The list of all available implementations can be found in the [implementations](https://github.com/Fevol/obsidian-typings/tree/main/src/implementations) folder.)
