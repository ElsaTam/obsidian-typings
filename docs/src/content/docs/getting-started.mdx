description: Learn how to use the Obsidian Typings in your Obsidian plugin.
---

Obsidian Typings is a TypeScript library that provides type definitions for private parts of the Obsidian API.
This project is not officially affiliated with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Prerequisites

Before using this package, make sure to read through the [disclaimer](/obsidian-typings/disclaimer/)
to understand the risks associated with using these typings.

You will need to have a plugin template set up with a package manager and TypeScript.
If you don't have one yet, follow the ["Build a plugin"](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin) guide
in the official Obsidian docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'

<Steps>
    1. **Installation** <br/>
        Obsidian Typings is a [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/obsidian-typings) that you can install using your favorite package manager:
        <PackageManagers pkg="obsidian-typings" dev={true} pkgManagers={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}/>
    2. **Add `obsidian-typings` to `types` in `tsconfig.json`** (_recommended_) <br/>
        Register the types from `obsidian-typings` to your project with the `tsconfig.json` file.
        ```diff lang="json"
            // tsconfig.json
            {
                "compilerOptions": {
                    "...": "...",
        +           "types": [
        +               "obsidian-typings"
        +           ]
                }
            }
        ```
        :::remark
        If you added the `types` field to your `tsconfig.json`, and `@types/some-package-name` does not get recognized anymore, you may need to re-add it to `types`:
        ```diff lang="json"
        // tsconfig.json
        {
            "compilerOptions": {
                "...": "...",
                "types": [
                    "obsidian-typings",
        +            "some-package-name"
                ]
            }
        }
        ```
        :::
	3. **Explicit type importing** <br/>
        If you prefer not to add `obsidian-typings` to your `types`, you can also add `import 'obsidian-typings';` to any project file.

    4. **Using `obsidian-typings/implementations`** <br/>
        Depending on how your project is set up, `import { X } from 'obsidian-typings/implementations';` may not work straight out of the box, e.g., if you have `"moduleResolution": "node"` or `"node10"` in your `tsconfig.json`. <br/><br/>
        To solve this, you can add the following to your `tsconfig.json`:

        ```diff lang="json"
        // tsconfig.json
        {
            "compilerOptions": {
                "...": "...",
                "paths": {
        +           "obsidian-typings/implementations": [
        +               "./node_modules/obsidian-typings/dist/implementations.d.ts",
        +               "./node_modules/obsidian-typings/dist/implementations.cjs"
        +           ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
</Steps>

That's it! Now the type definitions should be accessible in your project.
