description: Help improve the Obsidian Typings package by contributing to the project.

import { CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { LinkCardIcon } from '../../components';

This project accepts contributions of all kind, be it for documentation improvements, fixing incorrect typings
or adding entirely new typings for yet undocumented parts of the Obsidian API.

## General Notes

Feel free to start typing any part of the Obsidian API that is not yet typed, or fixing/adding additional descriptions to existing typings.
If you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to open an issue.

### Guides

Some guides are provided for you to get started with contributing to the project:

<CardGrid>
    <LinkCardIcon
        icon="seti:json"
        title="Adding New Typings"
        href="/obsidian-typings/guides/adding-new-typings"
        description="Learn how to find, discover and add new typings."
    />

    <LinkCardIcon
        icon="magnifier"
        title="Analyzing Source Code"
        href="/starlight-site-graph/components/analyzing-source-code"
        description="Learn how to analyze the minified source code of Obsidian."
    />
</CardGrid>

### TSDoc

Please use [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) to document the typings. This will allow the documentation to be automatically generated
within your IDE, and can help with the discoverability of the typings.

Example:

```ts
interface someObject {
    /**
     * Does something specific
     * @param val1 Enables some functionality
     * @tutorial Useful for implementing some features for your plugin
     * @remark Prefer using `someOtherMethod` instead
     */
    someMethod(val1: boolean): number;

    /**
     * Does something that you're not certain about, and should probably not be used
     * @internal
     */
    someInternalMethod(): void;
}
```

:::note
`@internal` — Method is _very likely_ not fully/correctly typed, and/or is not intended to be used by plugins.

`@remark` — Alternatives that should be used instead, or warnings about the function.

`@tutorial` — Short description on how the function could be used in your plugin.

`@deprecated` — Method is deprecated in a particular version (can't be found in `app.js` anymore).
